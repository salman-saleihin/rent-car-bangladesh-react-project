      "Driving is the controlled operation and movement of a vehicle, including cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses, and bicycles. Permission to drive on public highways is granted based on a set of conditions being met and drivers are required to follow the established road and traffic laws in the location they are driving.Choose a route. Many people who take road trips like to take the scenic route to their chosen destination. You can use a map or the internet to plan a route. Some drivers prefer to take a back roads rather than interstate highways when they go on road trips. Although it may take longer to reach your destination on these roads, the views will be much more interesting.",

      "A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people (rather than goods). Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.Plan for stops. It is reasonable to estimate that you will need to take a break from travelling every two or three hours. If there is an interesting city, park, store, or restaurant that you would like to see on your road trip, schedule stops accordingly. It is all part of the road trip experience.",

      "Decide on a destination. It is a good idea to choose a destination that is not too far away for your first road trip. A road trip can span only one day. For example, choose a city a couple of hours away for your first road trip. You will enjoy a nice drive to your destination, spend some time in a new place, and drive back home all in one day.Bring entertainment. Of course, the driver needs to focus his or her attention on the road. The passengers, however, might want some entertainment along the way. Portable DVD players with headphones, MP3 players, books, crossword puzzles, magazines, and travel journals are some excellent ideas for passing the time on a road trip.",
